# Forward-Backward Splitting Algorithm

Implementation of the Forward-Backward Splitting algorithm for solving unconstrained optimization problems involving
non-smooth functions.

`problem_set.py` file can be used to generate problems.  
`fbs.py` contains the implementation of the algorithm, with the objective function baked into the code.
